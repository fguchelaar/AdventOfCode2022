# 05 [Supply Stacks]

Parsing the input was the hardest part. For the stacks, I decided to just use arrays
since the number of crates is pretty small. Performance-issues were not anticipated.

This turned out to be a good choice with regard to part 2.

Ow... and simple strings are a hassle in Swift :/
