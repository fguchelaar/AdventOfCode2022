# 13 [Distress Signal]

I really didn't look forward to the parsing-part of this problem. After some 
thought I decided to go with `JSONSerialization`. That helped a bunch.

After solving it with fairly verbose code, I stumbled upon a [solution][1] in C# by
_[ensce][2]_. That gave further inspiration to my final solution.
